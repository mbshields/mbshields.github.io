If you have questions, noticed a bug, or want to get the latest project news, you can connect with us in the following ways:

1. Open a bug or feature enhancement [issue](https://github.com/projectsveltos/sveltos-manager/issues) on GitHub.

    First, check whether your issue has already been filed by someone else by doing an issue search. If the issue not found, file a new issue by clicking the *New issue* button on the *zot/issues* page and answering the questions. The more information that you can provide, the easier it becomes to triage the issue.
